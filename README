In order to use this software you will need the following...

* MySQL on the local machine (if you know how to change it to use another
  server, more power to you)
* MySQL Perl Module installed and working!
* Promisance is written in PERL, NOT Active Server Page scripts (the
  reason for this was so Apache would properly cache the scripts)
* Preferrably Apache, but I think any *nix web server should work
* If you are using Apache and have mod_fastcgi installed, use it, MUCH faster
* Knowledge of Perl (the code is not commented very much...)

I have included the MySQL databases (empty) to save you some time.

I will support this software to a point... that point has yet to be determined
E-Mail address: webmaster@promisance.com.  Edit the software all you want, but
you must redistribute it with the source.  My suggestion, e-mail it to
newcode@promisance.com and we'll take a peek at it for ya.
