To install Promisance, you will need:

1. A webserver (Apache is preferred)
2. PHP4 version 4.0.5 or greater; you may use a module for your
   webserver, but the CGI binary is required for the turns script
3. PHP GD library 1.8 or greater for the '# players registered' image
   generator
4. MySQL version 3.23.36 or greater
5. Knowledge necessary to configure crontab jobs.

Installing Promisance can be done in nine easy steps:

1. Extract Promisance to its own path, one visible from your web
   server.

2. If you wish to add new races or eras, edit prom.sql to your liking.
   Note that if you wish to add additional eras, you must also edit:
   * funcs.php:      line 201, to define exploration multipliers
                     line 252, to define any era bonuses while taking
                               turns
   * magicfun.php:   line 87, to define the magic spell names
   * promisance.css: line 119, to define the era-specific colors

3. Create a MySQL database for Promisance.
   If you cannot create a database (e.g. you do not have permission),
   you may rename the SQL tables by editing prom.sql and const.php
   accordingly.

4. Create the MySQL tables:
   $ mysql -uusername -p[password] databasename <prom.sql

5. Edit const.php to your liking (taking care to set the database
   host/login/password variables)

6. Browse to the folder in which you have installed Promisance.
   Click the 'Signup' link and create your account.
   You will be given the following privileges:
   * 'Set User' to any other user in the game.
   * User Administration - check for multis, disable/delete accounts,
     etc.
   * Clan Administration - edit any clan as if you are the founder.
   * View Empire Communications - filter through all messages sent
     in-game; this is ideal for bringing attention to usage of
     profanity or any other violations of game rules.

7. Copy the following text into the public page from which you will
   allow users to create accounts and log into Promisance:

<img style="background-color:white;width:48px;height:16px" src="/promisance/promisance.php?action=count&amp;digits=3&amp;style=1" alt="[num]"> Players Registered<br>
<form method="post" action="/promisance/promisance.php?action=login">
<div>
Username: <input type="text" name="login_username" size="8"><br>
Password: <input type="password" name="login_password" size="8"><br>
<input type="submit" name="do_login" value="Login">
</div>
</form>
<a href="/promisance/promisance.php?action=signup"><b>- Create Empire -</b></a><br>
<a href="/promisance/promisance.php?action=top10"><b>- Top 10 Players -</b></a><br>

8. Make a crontab entry to run the turns script:
   "/usr/local/bin/php turns.php"
   substituting the proper path to the PHP CGI binary.
   Schedule it according to the settings you chose in const.php.

9. If you wish to use the game's directory as a front page, you may
   edit index.php, removing the Header("...") command and replacing it
   with code to generate your own front page.

Notes:
    The first account created is given administrative privileges.
It is flagged such that other empires are not capable of attacking or
sending aid to you.  As such, you will also be unable to access the war
center and you will not be allowed to join clans.
    Through User Administration, you may appoint other users to be
administrators, giving them the same abilities and restrictions as
you.
