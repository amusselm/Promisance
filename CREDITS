QM Promisance code written by The Quietust and Morvandium
Based on code from EZClan Promisance, by Tom Finnell and Jordan Heine<br>
And Nuitari's Promisance

All the testers in all forms throughout the whole project and everyone who's given Promisance a shot either playing or running it
... from those testing the original Visual Basic version (*shiver*) to the latest and greatest.
Without the testers and everyone involved, there is no way Promisance would be where it is today and I can't thank them enough.
